# Microservices with Express.js MongoDB and TypeScript powered by Docker

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a microservice in Node using Express and TypeScript, experimenting with Docker.

## How to run the app

```js
docker-compose up --build --force-recreate
```

Docker will create two separate containers, one for the nodejs app and one for mongodb.
